This is a Random Quote Generator made as a FreeCodeCamp project.

It's written in HTML, CSS and JS using Bootstrap, Animate.CSS and JQuery.

I used an object array containing objects with quotes and authors, then used a random number generator to pick the quote.
There's also a button to tweet your quote.
